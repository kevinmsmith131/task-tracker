# TaskTracker
A task management app that allows users to create a list of tasks, and track which tasks on the list have been completed.

## How do I start tracking?
You can access the application using this url: https://heroku-task-tracker.herokuapp.com/

If you would like to see what the app looks like for a user who has already logged some tasks, you can use the demo which has a login of `demo` and a password of `!1234abcd!`. 

If you wish to make your own account, it should be noted that usernames must consist of `alphanumeric, _, @, +, . and -` characters, and passwords must have `eight` characters, one of which must be a special character.
